#  Learning Spring Application development Contest

***
This is a contest based on **Learning Spring Framework**. The idea is to submit a small, pithy, cool Spring Boot application to win a prize. We will soon announce the prizes.

Well, we aren't looking for obfuscated, complex, impossible to read apps. But we are looking for slick, cool apps that show off the power/coolness/wicked abilities of Spring Boot mixed with your hackable creativity. Characteristics the judges evaluate include:

* Stylish
* Short and sweet
* Custom auto-configurations are welcome
* Nice on the server side OR cool frontends (You don't have to build a web frontend to have a slick, elegeant, and original UI.)
* Tweet things up while you work on your submission.

**How/when to submit**

IMPORANT: Deadline is June 30th.

To submit an entery:

*  Fork this repo.
*  Code your solution inside your fork.
*  Tweet/blog/facebook your efforts.
*  Submit a pull request (before the deadline!!!)
*  Wait to see the announcement.
*  Collect your prize!

Those of you that can't wait, use the holiday time as you wish. Those of you that are enjoying time with family and friends, we included enough time so you can still get into the contest.

Good luck!
